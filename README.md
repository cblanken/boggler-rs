## Performance
### Data structures
Following are a few potential data structures to store the necessary word dictionaries.
- HashMap (and variations)
- Trie / prefix tree
- Radix trie / compact prefix tree / compressed trie

Note: it would be a good idea to setup a consistent API for creating, populating, and searching these dictionary data structures (Use Rust Traits?).

### Measurements
